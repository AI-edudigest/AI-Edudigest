              Traditional college marketing - newspaper ads, brochures, and college fairs - still work, but they're 
              not enough anymore. Today's students spend most of their time online, using social media and search 
              engines to find information about colleges.

                <strong>AI helps colleges create personalized marketing</strong> that speaks directly to each student's 
                interests and needs. Instead of sending the same message to everyone, AI can create different messages 
                for different types of students - those interested in engineering, arts, or commerce - making marketing 
                much more effective.

                AI can write social media posts, create attractive graphics, and even make promotional videos quickly 
                and cheaply. This means even small colleges can create professional-looking marketing materials without

                admission procedures, and campus life. These chatbots never get tired and can handle hundreds of

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                AI helps colleges manage their social media presence by automatically posting content at the best 
                times when students are most likely to see it. It can also monitor what people are saying about the 
                college online and alert staff to respond quickly to both positive and negative comments.

                Personalized email campaigns powered by AI can send different messages to different students based 
                on their course interests, location, and academic background. For example, AI can send engineering-focused 
                content to students interested in technical courses and arts-focused content to humanities students.
